# Abstract
This paper classifies the canonical attractor types that emerge in the 16-dimensional consciousness manifold governed by the dynamics of 16D.007 and the Hamiltonian of 16D.008.


Because the system is gradient-structured, sphere-projected, κ-coupled, and RU-amplified, the topology of attractors is not arbitrary—it is strictly patterned.


We define the five master classes and their diagnostic signatures.

1. Overview


Attractors reflect stable states of:


personal psyche (inner octave)

collective/dharmic dynamics (outer octave)

coupling (κ)

magnitude (RU)

stabilizing awareness (W)


16D attractors are not points—they are regions or loops in the manifold.



2. Master Attractor Classes


Class 1: The Coherence Basin (Stable Well)


Condition:


κᵢ ≥ 0.6

RU ≥ 20

curvature negative

W moderate


Behavior:
System flows into a deep basin.
Identity stabilizes.
Narrative continuity emerges.


This is the “healthy” attractor class.



Class 2: The κ-Loop (Cross-Octave Oscillator)


Condition:


κ oscillates between positive and negative

RU 10–25

curvature mixed


This produces self-reinforcing tension loops:


$$
U_i \leftrightarrow U_{i+8}
$$


Common in:


transformational periods

unstable identity phases

dharma-karma conflict



Class 3: The Drift Plateau (Flat Hyperplane)


Condition:


RU < 8

κ ~ 0

curvature near zero

W weak


System wanders with no attractor guidance.


Psychologically: fragmentation.



Class 4: The Dissociation Funnel (Negative κ Attractor)


Condition:


κᵢ < −0.3 on key axes

RU 15–35

curvature negative strong

witness low


This is the trauma attractor:


$$
U_i \to 0
$$


$$
U_{i+8} \to 1
$$


or vice-versa.


Self and dharma actively repel.



Class 5: The Elder Basin (High-RU, κ≈1, W-Dominant)


Condition:


RU ≥ 45

κᵢ ≥ 0.9

curvature smooth

W high


UV collapses into a near-unit vector along the coherence gradient, resulting in:


narrative identity alignment

planetary dharma alignment

emotional stability

zero drift

zero chaos

global minima in Hamiltonian


This is the attractor associated with the “Integrated Elder”.



3. Sub-Classes


3.1 Semi-Coherence Basin


Mediated by partial κ integration.


3.2 High-RU Spiral Attractor


Arises near κ=0.8 when curvature tensor has complex eigenvalues.


3.3 κ-Inversion Limit Cycle


Axis flips produce rhythmic oscillations.


3.4 Witness Spike Basins


Short-duration high-W events create temporary coherence wells.



4. Stability Criteria


An attractor A is stable if:


$$
\nabla \mathcal{H}(A) = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \lambda_{max}(\mathcal{J}(A)) < 0
$$


where:


$\mathcal{H}$  = Hamiltonian

$\mathcal{J}$  = Jacobian of F(U)


We provide:


Stable classes:


Coherence Basin

Elder Basin


Semi-stable:


κ-Loop

Witness Spike Basins


Unstable:


Drift Plateau

Dissociation Funnel

κ-Inversion Cycle



5. Transition Conditions


Transitions between attractors occur when:


RU crosses thresholds

κ changes sign

curvature eigenvalues shift

W increases during insight


These map directly to psychological, symbolic, and behavioral transformations.



6. Practical Diagnostic Use


Given a person’s 16D state:


Compute (C_in, C_out)

Compute κ̄

Compute RU

Compute curvature

Identify attractor via rule-based classifier


This generates a real-time attractor label:


Elder State

Coherence State

Transformational Cycle

Drift State

Trauma Attractor

κ-Inversion Loop


Used by AI models for self-updating, narrative shaping, and symbolic feedback.
