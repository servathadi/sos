# Abstract
This paper defines the drift-correction architecture and error-diffusion logic for the 16-dimensional Universal Vector (UV).
Because the system is nonlinear, stiff at high RU, coupling-dependent, and sphere-projected, numerical drift is unavoidable.
16D.010 provides the exact correction logic required to preserve simulation integrity across millions of timesteps.

# 4. Results or Derivations
1. Sources of Drift


Drift in UV simulations comes from:


Witness normalization

κ viscous evolution

RU inertia

curvature effects

integration method mismatch (RK vs symplectic)

boundary saturation (U ∈ [0,1])


Left unchecked, drift produces:


divergence

oscillation

artificial attractors

κ-instability

RU misestimation


16D.010 eliminates these.



2. UV Projection Drift


After each step, UV is normalized:


$$
\mathbf{U} \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{U}}{|\mathbf{U}|}
$$


This inevitably introduces a small perturbation:


$$
\epsilon_U = \mathbf{U}{proj} - \mathbf{U}{raw}
$$


This ε must be tracked, not discarded.



3. Error Reservoir


Maintain a running reservoir:


$$
\mathcal{E}(t+\Delta t) = \rho \mathcal{E}(t) + (1-\rho)\epsilon_U
$$


with ρ ∈ [0.1, 0.4].


This reservoir:


accumulates slow drift

dampens oscillatory error

retains long-arc structure

makes the simulation asymptotically unbiased



4. Error-Corrected Update Rule


At each step:


$$
\mathbf{U}_{corr} = \mathbf{U} - \lambda_E \mathcal{E}
$$


Where λ_E ≈ 0.02–0.1 depending on RU.


Interpretation:


low RU → modest correction

high RU → aggressive correction

RU > 45 → apply twice per step



5. κ-Error Correction


κ accumulates small systematic biases.


Correct via:


$$
\kappa_i \leftarrow \kappa_i - \sigma_E , \epsilon_U^{(i)} \epsilon_U^{(i+8)}
$$


This prevents:


κ inflation

κ runaway negativity

κ oscillatory inversion



6. RU Drift Correction


Derived RU obeys:


$$
RU_{corr} = RU - \xi \left|\epsilon_U\right|
$$


This ensures:


high drift → RU drops (consistent with biological coherence loss)

low drift → RU rises


RU becomes self-stabilizing.



7. Boundary Saturation Correction


UV is bounded:
U_i ∈ [0,1]


If projection or integration push U_i outside bounds, apply:


$$
U_i \leftarrow \begin{cases} 0 + \delta_b & \text{if } U_i < 0 \\\\ 1 - \delta_b & \text{if } U_i > 1 \\\\ U_i & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$


δ_b = 1e-6 prevents numerical collapse at edges.



8. Stability Summary


The combined system:


prevents UV drift

prevents κ explosion

stabilizes RU

makes long-arc simulation reliable


This completes the computational infrastructure from 16D.009.
