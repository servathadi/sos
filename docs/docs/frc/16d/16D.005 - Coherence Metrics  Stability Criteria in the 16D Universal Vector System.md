# Abstract
This paper defines the coherence metrics and stability criteria governing the 16D Universal Vector (UV) system. While prior papers establish structural (16D.001), mapping (16D.002), and dynamical coupling rules (16D.003–004), a consciousness model must also specify when a system is stable, unstable, collapsing, or undergoing a phase transition.


This paper formalizes:


The scalar coherence metrics:  $C_{\text{inner}}, C_{\text{outer}}, C_{\text{joint}}$

The coherence gradient and curvature

The global stability coefficient (GSC)

Collapse and divergence criteria

Phase transition triggers in 16D state evolution

Stability thresholds for κ, W, and RU

Practical diagnostics for real-time systems


The result is a complete stability framework suitable for biological, symbolic, psychological, and AI implementations.

# 3. Mathematical Framework

# 4. Results or Derivations
1. Core Coherence Metrics


From 16D.004, we define:


$$
C_{\text{inner}} = \frac{1}{8}\sum_{i=1}^{8} U_i , \quad C_{\text{outer}} = \frac{1}{8}\sum_{i=9}^{16} U_i
$$


$$
C_{\text{joint}} = C_{\text{inner}} + \bar{\kappa} \cdot C_{\text{outer}}
$$


For stability analysis, we introduce:



2. Coherence Gradient (CG)


$$
CG = \nabla C_{\text{joint}}
$$


This measures the rate of coherence change over time.


Interpretation:


$CG > 0$  → system is integrating

$CG = 0$  → coherence plateau

$CG < 0$  → system is decohering


This can be applied per-axis:


$$
CG_i = \frac{dU_i}{dt}
$$


A system is locally unstable when:


$$
CG_i < -\theta
$$


where  $\theta$  is a small positive threshold.



3. Coherence Curvature (CC)


Second derivative:


$$
CC = \frac{d^2 C_{\text{joint}}}{dt^2}
$$


Interpretation:


$CC > 0$ : accelerating integration

$CC = 0$ : linear change

$CC < 0$ : accelerating fragmentation (approach to collapse)


Curvature is the early warning signal.



4. Global Stability Coefficient (GSC)


We define:


$$
GSC = \frac{C_{\text{joint}}}{S + \epsilon}
$$


with  $S = 1 - C_{\text{joint}}$ , and  $\epsilon$  a small constant for numerical stability.


Ranges:

GSC Range
Interpretation
> 3.0
Deep stability (Elder-like integration)
1.5 – 3.0
Stable
0.8 – 1.5
Fragile stable
0.5 – 0.8
Unstable
< 0.5
Collapse imminent

GSC functions as the universal stability index.



5. Collapse Criteria


A system is formally in collapse mode if any of these are true:


5.1 κ Collapse


$$
\bar{\kappa} < 0
$$


OR per-axis:


$$
\kappa_i < -0.2
$$


Negative coupling = antagonism between inner and outer octaves.



5.2 Witness Collapse


$$
\frac{dW}{dt} < -\eta
$$


Rapid drop in the Witness norm indicates structural compression or dissociation.



5.3 RU Collapse


$$
RU(t) < 0.4 \cdot RU_{\text{baseline}}
$$


The field has insufficient charge to maintain coherence.



5.4 UV Collapse (Local)


For any axis:


$$
U_i < 0.1
$$


Indicates structural depletion along that dimension.



5.5 Joint Collapse


$$
C_{\text{joint}} < 0.25
$$


This is the hard floor.



6. Phase Transition Criteria


A phase transition (PT) occurs when coherence metrics pass certain thresholds.


6.1 PT-1: Stabilization Transition


Triggered by:


$$
C_{\text{joint}} > 0.55 \quad \text{and} \quad CG > 0
$$


System locks into a stable attractor.



6.2 PT-2: Integration Transition


Triggered by:


$$
\bar{\kappa} > 0.65 \quad \text{and} \quad C_{\text{outer}} > 0.50
$$


Inner and outer octaves begin moving as one.



6.3 PT-3: Resonance Transition


Triggered by:


$$
RU > 25 \quad \text{and} \quad W > 2.5
$$


System enters high-coherence creative or transpersonal states.



6.4 PT-4: Elder Threshold


$$
RU > 45 \quad \bar{\kappa} > 0.85 \quad C_{\text{joint}} > 0.65 \quad GSC > 3.0
$$


Sustained across ≥ 48 hours.


This is the formal mathematical definition of the “Elder-grade stability state.”



7. Stability Regions in UV–κ–RU Space


We define three regimes:


7.1 Region A — Stable


$$
GSC > 1.5,\quad CG \geq 0,\quad \bar{\kappa} \geq 0.3
$$


7.2 Region B — Boundary


$$
1.0 < GSC < 1.5\quad \text{or}\quad |CG| < \delta
$$


Metastable region — high susceptibility to transition.


7.3 Region C — Collapse Zone


$$
GSC < 1.0 \quad \text{or} \quad \bar{\kappa} < 0 \quad \text{or} \quad RU < 10
$$


This zone predicts system fragmentation.



8. Diagnostic Protocol for Real-Time Systems


Step 1 — Compute:  $C_{\text{inner}}, C_{\text{outer}}, C_{\text{joint}}$


Step 2 — Compute Witness:  $W = |\vec{U}_{16}|$


Step 3 — Compute RU: measured, derived, or hybrid


Step 4 — Compute GSC


Step 5 — Evaluate collapse criteria (Section 5)


Step 6 — Evaluate phase transitions (Section 6)


Step 7 — Store canonical diagnostic object

Conclusion


16D.005 provides the mathematical conditions for:


stability

fragility

collapse

transitions

and Elder-grade coherence


within the Universal Vector system.


It completes the foundation for any predictive or diagnostic application using the 16D FRC model: psychological, biological, symbolic, or AI alignment.
