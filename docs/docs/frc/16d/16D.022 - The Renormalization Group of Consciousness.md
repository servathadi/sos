# Abstract
Every layered system — from particle physics to ecosystems to civilizations — follows renormalization: the laws change with scale, and the same structure appears again at new magnitudes.


This paper introduces the FRC Renormalization Group (RG) for the 16D Universal Vector (UV), showing how:


μ-levels scale

archetypes recur fractally

personal karma ↔ cultural dharma mirror

identities compress and expand

coherence transforms with scale

a person, a culture, and a cosmos share identical mathematics


This is the first explicit formulation of scaling laws in consciousness.

1. Why Renormalization Applies to Psyche


In physics, renormalization describes:


how interactions behave at different scales

how coupling constants flow

how complexity simplifies

how universal patterns emerge


Consciousness has:


micro → thoughts

meso → identity

macro → myth / culture

cosmic → archetypal field


Thus it necessarily has an RG flow.



2. The FRC Scaling Parameter (ℓ)


Define the logarithmic scale parameter:


$$
\ell = \ln(\text{scale})
$$


Increasing ℓ moves from:


individual experience → μ1–μ3

personal identity → μ4

symbolic / archetypal → μ5–μ6

universal witness → μ7


Thus ℓ is the magnification of meaning.



3. The Renormalization Flow Equation


Let g be the set of coupling constants in the 16D system:


$$
g = (\kappa, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \dots)
$$


The RG equation is:


$$
\boxed{\frac{d g}{d\ell} = \beta(g)}
$$


Where β(g) is the beta function (not temperature beta).


Interpretation:


As we zoom out (higher ℓ), couplings change

Weak forces become strong

Strong tensions smooth out

Archetypes recur

Identity reorganizes

Patterns repeat at new scales



4. The Five RG Regimes of Human Consciousness


Regime I — Micro (μ1–μ2)


Thoughts, impulses, emotions.
RG behaviour: chaotic, sensitive to initial conditions.
Coupling: κ small, dominated by internal noise.


Regime II — Mesoscale (μ3–μ4)


Identity, ego, roles.
RG behaviour: stable fixed points.
Coupling: κ stabilizes, patterns repeat.


Regime III — Symbolic (μ5)


Mythic imagination, dreams, archetypes.
RG behaviour: fractal recurrences.
Coupling: κ increases sharply; synchronicity begins.


Regime IV — Meta-symbolic (μ6)


Witness, pattern seeing, system cognition.
RG behaviour: universality — different micro patterns look similar at large scale.
Coupling: κ renormalizes toward unity.


Regime V — Transpersonal (μ7)


Pure consciousness.
RG behaviour: fixed point, scale-invariant.
Coupling: κ → 1 (full coherence).


This is the flow of the soul through complexity.



5. Fixed Points of Consciousness


A fixed point satisfies:


$$
\beta(g^*) = 0
$$


Three major fixed points exist:


1. Infrared Fixed Point (IRFP): Survival Identity


μ1–μ3 dominance.
Low coherence.
Entropy-generating.
Default human mode.


2. Intermediate Fixed Point (IMFP): Ego Identity


μ4 stabilized.
Narrative self formed.
Most adults stay here.


3. Ultraviolet Fixed Point (UVFP): Elder / μ7


Scale invariance.
No-self / total-self unity.
Large coherence basin.
Synchronicity constant.


This is the destination of true renormalization flow.



6. Universality Classes in Consciousness


Different psyches fall into “universality classes” — distinct macro behaviours, even if micro details differ.


Examples:


Class A — The Hero Type


Flow toward expansion, confrontation, suffering.


Class B — The Mystic Type


Flow toward dissolution, awareness, transcendence.


Class C — The Lover Type


Flow toward union, merging, resonance.


Class D — The Engineer Type


Flow toward structure, integration, clarity.


Class E — The Trickster Type


Flow toward inversion, generativity, entropy manipulation.


Same equations → different basins.



7. Scaling Law: Archetypes Are Renormalized Structures


Archetypes appear at every scale because:


$$
\Phi_{\text{macro}}(\ell) = \mathcal{R}\ell [\phi{\text{micro}}]
$$


The macro-pattern (culture, myth) is just the micro-pattern (childhood story) renormalized.


This explains:


why personal trauma mirrors cultural trauma

why individual awakening mirrors historical epochs

why your inner Trickster becomes society’s Trickster in meta-scale

why the Hero’s Journey appears in civilizations as well as people


Archetypes are renormalization invariants.



8. κ Under Renormalization


Coupling flow:


$$
\frac{d\kappa}{d\ell} = f(\kappa, C, W)
$$


Behaviour:


Small κ → grows under scaling (resonance increases)

Medium κ → stable for long phases

Large κ → decays (to prevent total enmeshment)


This explains:


trauma resolving (κ small → κ grows)

awakening stabilizing (κ moderate stable)

psychotic merging (κ too large → decays into collapse)


κ has an RG window for sanity.



9. Universality Across Scales (Self = Culture = Cosmos)


Renormalization shows that:


your psyche

your culture

the universe


are the same mathematical entity at different ℓ.


This means:


$$
\text{Person} \sim \text{Civilization} \sim \text{Cosmos}
$$


They differ only by scale, not by structure.


This is the foundation of:


astrology

mythic resonance

synchronicity

archetypal mirroring

cultural cycles


There is one pattern.
Scaling changes the appearance, not the structure.



10. The μ-Level Scaling Law


$$
\mu(\ell) = \log_2(\text{complexity}(\ell))
$$


Thus:


doubling complexity moves you one μ-level

μ7 is the fixed point of infinite complexity (scale invariance)


This blurs:


mind/body

human/divine

self/cosmos

astrology/physics

myth/history


into a unified fractal flow.



11. Closing Sentence


Renormalization shows that consciousness is a scale-invariant fractal: the same structure repeats in thoughts, lives, cultures, and stars, each a magnified echo of the last.
