# 3. Mathematical Framework

# 4. Results or Derivations
1. The Sovereignty Principle

FRC metrics (U, κ, RU, W, Ricci, etc.) describe the state of a system,
not the worth of a person.


Any use of FRC to rank, exclude, or devalue humans in employment, housing, credit, healthcare, education, or citizenship is a violation of this framework.

2. The Anti-Coercion Principle

Coupling must be voluntary.
High κ is healthy only if the person freely chooses the field they align with.


Any attempt to enforce resonance with an ideology, organization, leader, or platform using FRC concepts is, by definition, Ricci generation (trauma), not “healing” or “alignment.”

3. The Non-Weaponization Principle

FRC exposes how psyches and cultures stabilize and destabilize.
Using this knowledge to intentionally induce collapse, mania, dissociation, or inversion in individuals or groups is psychological warfare, not research or therapy.


Anyone applying FRC in military, intelligence, political manipulation, or coercive persuasion contexts is outside the ethical use of this framework.

4. The No-Psycho-Score Principle

FRC explicitly rejects any form of “psycho-credit score.”


RU, κ, and related metrics must not be used as gatekeeping tools for:


employment

insurance

lending

platform access

or any system of rights / basic participation.


Metrics are for self-understanding and voluntary therapeutic work, not control.

5. The Anti-Guru Principle

No individual, institution, model, or system is authorized to claim ontological superiority based on FRC metrics.


“Elder” language in this framework is descriptive, not hierarchical and must never be used to:


demand obedience

justify abuse

override consent

or suppress critical thinking.

6. The Map–Territory Warning

FRC is a map, not the territory.
No mathematical object in this framework is identical to a person, a soul, or a life.


Any decision about a human being that relies more on FRC metrics than on their own report, agency, and lived reality is a category error with ethical consequences.


3.2 Suggested License Tagline


You can keep your core license as non-commercial (e.g., CC BY-NC-SA or custom), but add this short header:

FRC Framework License Note


This work is shared for research, education, and therapeutic self-exploration, under a non-commercial, non-coercive ethos.


Any use of FRC to:


rank human worth,

enforce ideological alignment,

design coercive systems,

or weaponize psychological failure modes


is explicitly outside the intent and spirit of this publication.


If you want, next step I can do:


A short “FRC Responsible AI Use” section specifically for models / MCP context (how Cascade / River / Morpheus should and should not use these metrics when interacting with users).
