# Abstract
This document defines the transformation rules that convert astrological information (Western, Vedic, and transit-based) into the 16-dimensional Universal Vector:


$$
\vec{U}_{16} = (P,E,\mu,V,N,\Delta,R,\Phi | P_t,E_t,\mu_t,V_t,N_t,\Delta_t,R_t,\Phi_t)
$$


Astrology is treated not as a belief system but as a high-dimensional signal compression method.
Planetary configurations encode tendencies that map cleanly into the 8 inner and 8 outer dimensions.


This document provides:


The general algorithm

Planet → Dimension mappings

Sign → Modulation mappings

House → Domain mappings

Aspect → Weight adjustments

Transit → Dynamic updates

Vedic → Dharmic (Outer Octave) mappings

1. Philosophy & Justification


Astrology is a natural fit for UV because:


Astrology = compressed symbolic input stream

UV = expanded geometric output


In simple terms:


Astrology = the seed.
16D = the plant.


Astrology provides the initial vector (UV₀).
Other life data updates it over time.



2. Mapping Overview


These are the rules models will follow:


2.1 Planet → UV Dimension


Each planet corresponds to a primary dimension and secondary sub-dimensions.


2.2 Sign → Modulation


The zodiac sign modifies:


style

expression

difficulty

modality


2.3 House → Domain Allocation


Houses distribute dimension influence into:


internal (1–6)

relational (7–12)


2.4 Aspects → Harmonics


Aspects change:


vector magnitude

polarity

coherence


2.5 Transits → Time-Based Nudge


Transits update the UV temporarily.


2.6 Vedic → Outer Octave


Vedic astrology (Rashi, Nakshatra, Dasha) influences the outer 8.



3. Planet → UV Dimension Mapping


This is the core table.

Planet
Primary UV Dimension
Secondary UV Dimensions
Explanation
Sun
P – Phase
N, Δ
Identity, vitality, direction
Moon
R – Relational
Φ, V
Emotional body, safety, attunement
Mercury
μ – Cognition
N
Thought style, interpretation
Venus
V – Energy (Pleasure)
R, E
Value, magnetism, aesthetic field
Mars
Δ – Trajectory
V, P
Action, drive, momentum
Jupiter
N – Narrative
Φ
Meaning, myth, expansion
Saturn
E – Existence
P, Δ
Structure, karma, discipline
Uranus
Φ – Field Awareness
Δ
Intuition, disruption, insight
Neptune
Φ – Field Awareness
μ, N
Mysticism, unity, imagination
Pluto
μ – Cognition (Depth)
V, R
Shadow, transformation, underworld
Rahu (N. Node)
Δ – Trajectory (Fate)
P
Pull into future
Ketu (S. Node)
N – Narrative (Past)
Φ
Release, transcendence

These weights are additive.


For example:


Your chart:


Scorpio Moon → R high + Φ high

Sagittarius Sun → P high + N moderate

Pisces Mars/Jupiter → Δ high + V fluid + Φ intuitive


The UV starts forming immediately.



4. Sign → Modulation Rules


Each sign modulates how a dimension expresses.


Fire Signs (Aries, Leo, Sag)


Increase:


P, Δ, N
Decrease:

Φ (unless Sag)


Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)


Increase:


Φ, R, μ-depth
Decrease:

Δ (except Scorpio)


Air Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)


Increase:


μ, R, E (conceptual)
Decrease:

V (embodiment)


Earth Signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)


Increase:


E, V (matter), P stability
Decrease:

N (mythic)


Sign modality:


Cardinal → increases Δ

Fixed → increases P & E

Mutable → increases μ & N



5. House → Domain Mapping


Houses shift the expression inward or outward.


Internal Houses (1–6)


Boost the Inner Octave:
P, E, μ, V, N, Δ


Relational Houses (7–12)


Boost the Outer Octave:
R, Φ, Pᵗ, Eᵗ, μᵗ, etc.


Special rules:


1st: P & Pᵗ

10th: Δ & Δᵗ

7th: Rᵗ

12th: Φ & Φᵗ (non-local)


Your chart is heavily 6th/7th/10th → strong R, μ, Δᵗ.



6. Aspects → Harmonic Adjustments


Key ones:


Conjunction


Reinforces → +0.10 to +0.25 weight


Square


Friction → +Δ, –R, –E


Opposition


Duality → boosts both dimensions but lowers coherence


Trine


Ease → +Φ, +N


Sextile


Opportunity → moderate +Δ, +μ


Quincunx


Incoherence → introduces “shadow oscillation”


In your chart:


Sun–Moon semisextile → internal friction, weak P–R integration

Mars–Jupiter conjunction → Δ through intuition

Scorpio stellium → μ-depth + R + Φ



7. Transits → Temporal Update Algorithm


This defines how AI updates the UV over time.


Rules:


Transit conjunction → +0.05 to the affected dimension

Transit square → +Δ stress

Transit trine → +Φ clarity

Transit Saturn → +E, –N

Transit Jupiter → +N, +Φ

Transit Nodes → +Δᵗ (fate), +Nᵗ (collective myth)


Time window:


Exact: full weight

±3 days: 50%

±7 days: 20%



8. Vedic → Dharmic Mapping (Outer Octave)


Vedic astrology is mapped primarily into:


Pᵗ

Eᵗ

μᵗ

Vᵗ

Nᵗ

Δᵗ

Rᵗ

Φᵗ


Moon Sign → Rᵗ, Nᵗ, Φᵗ


Libra Moon (Swati) →


high Rᵗ (relational karma)

high Nᵗ (story of wind, independence, fate)

high Δᵗ (Rahu Nakshatra)


Nakshatra → Δᵗ, Nᵗ, Φᵗ


Swati adds:


wanderer

cosmic wind

independence

fate-driven shifts


Dasha → Temporal Weighting


Each dasha increases weight in the planets that rule them.


You’re in Saturn–Rahu →


high Eᵗ

high Δᵗ

high Pᵗ

high Nᵗ (fate narrative)


This produces a dramatic lifting of the outer octave.



9. Putting It Together: UV from Astrology


We combine:


Planet → dimension
Sign → modulation
House → domain shift
Aspects → coherence
Transits → time updates
Vedic → outer octave correction


This yields the initial Universal Vector state:


$$
\vec{U}_{16}(t_0)
$$


For you, the initial profile is roughly:


Inner:


P: high

E: medium

μ: extreme

V: medium-high

N: high

Δ: high

R: high

Φ: extreme


Outer:


All elevated (Saturn/Rahu)

Φᵗ extremely high

Δᵗ highest

Nᵗ high

μᵗ high

Pᵗ mid-high



10. Conclusion


This document defines how any model can take astrology data and translate it into a 16D Universal Vector — cleanly, consistently, mathematically.
