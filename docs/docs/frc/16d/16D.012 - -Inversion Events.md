# Abstract
This paper defines the mathematical mechanism of κ-inversion, the process by which one or more coupling coefficients  $\kappa_i$  change sign, producing:


trauma loops (κ < 0),

dissociative attractors,

or healing convergence (κ→+1).


We provide:


definitions,

inversion triggers,

bifurcation rules,

healing dynamics,

and a full κ-inversion differential system.


The model is directly compatible with the 16D dynamics defined in 16D.007 and the attractor taxonomy of 16D.011.

1. Definition of κ-Inversion


Each axis pair (inner–outer) has a coupling coefficient:


$$
\kappa_i \in [-1,1]
$$


A κ-inversion event occurs when:


$$
\text{sign}(\kappa_i(t+\Delta t)) \neq \text{sign}(\kappa_i(t))
$$


This flips an axis from:


aligned → opposed

opposed → aligned

disconnected → coupled

trauma → coherence

bypass → integration


It is the core unit of psychological and mythic shift in the 16D model.



2. Mechanism of Inversion


κ evolves per the viscous update rule:


$$
\kappa_i(t+\Delta t) = \kappa_i(t) + \eta (U_i U_{i+8} - \kappa_i(t))
$$


Inversion occurs when:


$$
U_i U_{i+8} \quad\text{crosses}\quad 0
$$


Meaning:


Inner value and outer value point in opposite directions

Their dot-product flips sign


This is the exact mathematical signature of trauma OR major integration depending on direction.



3. Three Types of κ-Inversion


Type I — Trauma Inversion (positive → negative)


$$
\kappa_i : + \to -
$$


Triggered when:


inner & outer diverge violently

RU is moderate (10–25)

W is low

curvature tensor has a saddle-point


Outcome:


dissociation

avoidance loops

“inner rejects outer” or vice-versa


Matched to Class 4 attractor.



Type II — Insight Inversion (negative → positive)


$$
\kappa_i : - \to +
$$


Triggered when:


W spikes

RU is high (25–40)

inner & outer become coherent for a short window

curvature flattens


Outcome:


integration

healing

sudden unification of karma/dharma

axis regains function


Corresponds to deep therapy, spiritual insight, or symbolic realization.



Type III — Dharma Activation (zero → positive)


$$
\kappa_i : 0 \to +\epsilon
$$


Triggered when:


external field pushes system into alignment

RU slowly rises

C_out > C_in


Outcome:


new axis of purpose

new direction in life

identity growth


This is the “something new begins” attractor.



4. Bifurcation Conditions


A κ-inversion is a bifurcation in the 16D field.


Forward bifurcation (integration)


Occurs if:


$$
W > W_{crit} \quad\text{and}\quad RU > RU_{min}
$$


Backward bifurcation (fragmentation)


Occurs if:


$$
|U_i - U_{i+8}| > \delta \quad\text{and}\quad RU < RU_{frag}
$$


Critical values (empirical ranges):


$W_{crit} \approx 1.2–2.5$

$RU_{min} \approx 12$

$RU_{frag} \approx 8$

$\delta \approx 0.35–0.55$



5. Healing Dynamics Equation


When κ is negative, healing arises when:


$$
\frac{d\kappa_i}{dt} = \eta_+ \left( |U_i U_{i+8}| - |\kappa_i| \right)
$$


where:


$\eta_+$  > 0 is the healing viscosity

negative κ is slowly pulled upward

healing accelerates when inner & outer start synchronizing


This is the integration gradient.



6. Trauma Dynamics Equation


For κ > 0 flipping to κ < 0:


$$
\frac{d\kappa_i}{dt} = - \eta_- \left( |U_i - U_{i+8}| \right)
$$


Trauma accelerates when:


U_i and U_{i+8} diverge

RU is high but W is low

the system is in a high-curvature saddle


This matches clinical phenomenology.



7. κ-Inversion Cascade


Sometimes many κ_i invert in sequence.


Cascade occurs when:


$$
\frac{\partial \kappa_j}{\partial \kappa_i} > 0
$$


meaning one inversion destabilizes neighboring axes.


Signatures:


identity collapse

existential crisis

sudden shifts in worldview

massive realignment

or breakthrough coherence


Matched to large-scale life transitions.



8. 16D Attractor Consequences


If κ flips positive → negative:


shift into Dissociation Funnel

axis becomes self-opposed

trauma loops form


If κ flips negative → positive:


transition to Coherence Basin

identity and dharma unify

narrative stabilizes


If κ flips 0 → positive:


entry into Transformational Loop

new destiny vector emerges



9. Temporal Logic of κ


We define κ evolution as slow relative to U:


$$
\left| \frac{d\kappa}{dt} \right| \ll \left| \frac{d\mathbf{U}}{dt} \right|
$$


But at inversion moments:


$$
\left| \frac{d\kappa}{dt} \right| \to O(1)
$$


This models:


trauma spikes

healing breakthroughs

sudden recollection

symbolic revelation


κ becomes “fast” exactly when psychological reality does.



10. Diagnostics


Given a state:


Compute U_i U_{i+8}

Check for sign-cross

Compute λ_max of Jacobian

Compute RU and W

Identify inversion type:
Trauma


Insight

Activation


This enables real-time detection.



11. Therapeutic / Transformational Implications


Trauma = κ < 0

Healing = κ increases toward 0

Integration = κ > +0.5

Mastery = κ ≈ 1


These map to all forms of psychological and spiritual growth.



Conclusion


16D.012 defines:


The mathematics of κ-inversion

Trauma & healing as vector-field transitions

Attractor shifts

Bifurcation rules

Integration/fragmentation dynamics


This completes the coupling foundation of the 16D model.
