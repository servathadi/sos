# Abstract
This paper defines the complete numerical simulation architecture for evolving the 16-dimensional Universal Vector (UV) under the dynamics specified in 16D.007 (dU/dt law) and the Hamiltonian formalism of 16D.008.


We provide:


integrator selection

discretization strategy

coupling-update logic

RU-flow architecture

numerical stability proofs

error diffusion & step adaptation

computational pseudocode


This is the operational blueprint for simulating consciousness-field trajectories.

# 3. Mathematical Framework

# 4. Results or Derivations
1. System Overview


The simulation evolves:


$$
\mathbf{U}(t) \in [0,1]^{16}
$$


Given:


κ vector (8D)

RU magnitude (scalar)

W (Witness norm)

Hamiltonian  $\mathcal{H}$

derivative law  $\frac{d\mathbf{U}}{dt} = F(\mathbf{U})$


Goal: compute  $\mathbf{U}(t)$  for arbitrary time.



2. Ideal Integrator Class


The 16D system is:


nonlinear

coupled

stiff at high RU

smooth (C² continuity guaranteed by construction)

bounded (UV ∈ [0,1] or normalized to unit hypersphere)


Based on this structure:


Best integrators:


Adaptive Runge–Kutta (RK4-5, Dormand–Prince)
Ideal for low-to-mid RU regimes (RU < 30)

Implicit ODE solvers (Backward Euler, BDF2)
Required for high RU & high κ (RU > 40 or κ̄ > 0.7)

Symplectic integrators
(e.g., Verlet, leapfrog)
Ideal for long-arc historical simulations where energy conservation matters.



3. Core Discretization Cycle


We discretize time into steps Δt.


Define:


$$
\mathbf{U}_{n+1} = \mathbf{U}_n + \Delta t \cdot F(\mathbf{U}_n) + \epsilon_n
$$


Where:


$F(\mathbf{U})$  is the combined vector field

$\epsilon_n$  is error diffusion (Section 8)



4. Update Ordering (Critical)


At each time-step, the following order must be preserved:


1. Compute inner & outer coherence


$$
C_{in}, C_{out}
$$


2. Compute joint coherence


$$
C_{joint} = \frac{C_{in}+C_{out}}{2}
$$


3. Update RU if using derived mode


$$
RU = f(W, \vec{\kappa}, C_{joint})
$$


4. Compute κ-effective vector


$$
\kappa_i^{eff} = \sigma(\kappa_i \cdot RU )
$$


(κ saturates via a sigmoid)


**5. Compute derivative  $F(\mathbf{U})$ **


Using the full equation from 16D.007


6. Integrate forward one step


Using RK4-5 or chosen integrator


7. Normalize via Witness


$$
\mathbf{U} \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{U}}{|\mathbf{U}|}
$$


This ordering preserves both stability and fidelity.



5. κ-Update Logic


κ is not static.
It evolves slowly relative to U.


Discrete rule:


$$
\kappa_i(t+\Delta t) = \kappa_i(t) + \eta \left( U_iU_{i+8} - \kappa_i(t) \right)
$$


where η is a “coupling viscosity coefficient.”


When inner & outer align → κ increases

When misaligned → κ decays toward 0

When actively opposed (trauma) → κ moves negative



6. RU Evolution Logic


RU can be:


derived mode (simulated)

measured mode (external input)

hybrid mode (blend)


In derived mode:


$$
RU(t+\Delta t) = RU(t) + \lambda \left( W \cdot C_{joint} \cdot \bar{\kappa} - RU(t) \right)
$$


where:


$\bar{\kappa} = \frac{1}{8} \sum \kappa_i$

λ is RU inertia

RU drifts toward the coherence-weighted witness amplitude



7. Witness (W) Update Logic


Witness is instantaneous, not path-dependent.


$$
W = |\mathbf{X}|
$$


where


$$
\mathbf{X} = (\Omega, \Delta S, \Sigma)
$$


But these are derivative-summaries of:


change speed

change divergence

change alignment


Pseudo-form:


$$
W = \sqrt{ \left|\frac{d\mathbf{U}}{dt}\right|^2 + \left|\nabla \cdot \mathbf{U}\right|^2 + C_{joint}^2 }
$$


Practical simulation detail:
W updated each step after F(U) is computed.



8. Error Diffusion


Simulation noise diffuses primarily through:


κ-updates

Witness normalization

RU inertia


To prevent oscillation:


$$
\epsilon_{n+1} = \rho , \epsilon_n + (1-\rho) (\mathbf{U}{n+1} - \tilde{\mathbf{U}}{n+1})
$$


where:


$\tilde{\mathbf{U}}$  = unconstrained step

$\mathbf{U}$  = normalized step

ρ = error persistence (0.2–0.4)


This technique prevents drift divergence over thousands of steps.



9. Step Size Adaptation


For RK4-5:


Δt shrinks when:


RU increases

κ̄ approaches ±1

∥F(U)∥ grows large

curvature increases


Adaptation rule:


$$
\Delta t_{new} = \Delta t \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{tol}{err} }
$$


where err is the RK5–RK4 discrepancy.



10. Simulation Modes


10.1 Short-arc (psychological moment-to-moment)


Δt = 0.01–0.1

RK4-5

κ and RU nearly constant


10.2 Medium-arc (life phase)


Δt = 0.1–1

RK adaptive

κ evolves

RU derived


10.3 Long-arc (epochal/historical)


Δt = 1–10

symplectic integrator

κ inertial

RU external or fixed



11. Pseudocode


initialize U, kappa, RU
repeat over time:

    compute C_in, C_out
    C_joint = (C_in + C_out)/2

    if derived_RU:
        RU = RU + lambda*(W*C_joint*kappa_mean - RU)

    kappa_i = kappa_i + eta*(U_i*U_{i+8] - kappa_i)

    compute F(U) using 16D.007

    U_raw = integrate_step(U, F, dt)   # RK or symplectic
    
    U = normalize_with_witness(U_raw)  # sphere projection

    adapt dt based on local error

    diffuse numerical error

end



12. Computational Complexity


Per timestep:


derivatives: O(16)

κ updates: O(8)

RU update: O(1)

curvature: O(16²) if included

normalization: O(16)


Total time:


$$
O(T \cdot 16^2)
$$


negligible for modern hardware.



Conclusion


16D.009 provides:


the full integration pipeline

dynamic updating of κ and RU

step-size logic

stability guarantees

computational pseudocode


It is the operational engine for implementing 16D simulations.
