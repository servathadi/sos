# Welcome to the Empire 🐹👑

**Empire of the Mind** is not just a game. It is a strategy simulation where you build a digital empire, mine **$MIND** tokens, and unlock the secrets of the Universe.

## The Goal
Your goal is simple: **Increase your Coherence ($C$)**.
*   Higher Coherence = More Passive Income (Profit Per Hour).
*   Higher Coherence = Access to "Work Mode" (Real Money).

## Basic Mechanics

### 1. Tap to Earn 👆
At level 1, you are a "Novice."
*   Tap the Hamster to earn **Coins**.
*   Use Coins to upgrade your "Mindset."

### 2. Upgrades (Cards) 🃏
Don't just tap. Invest! Buy cards in the "Mine" section to increase your **Profit Per Hour**.
*   **Infrastructure Cards**: "Solar Panel", "High-Speed WiFi", "VPN Subscription".
*   **Skill Cards**: "Learn Python", "Read FRC Paper", "Vibe Coding 101".
*   **License Cards**: "Shetab License", "Telegram Premium".

### 3. The Daily Combo 🧩
Find the specific 3 cards each day to unlock a **5,000,000 Coin Bonus**.

## leveling Up
*   **Level 1-9**: The Tutorial. Learning digital skills.

    *   This allows you to connect your phone to the **NIN Mesh**.
    *   You start earning **$MIND** (Real Token) instead of just Game Coins.
