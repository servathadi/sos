# From Coins to $MIND 💸
Most games give you points that are worthless.
**Empire of the Mind** gives you **$MIND**—the currency of the Future.

## How it Works
1.  **Game Coins**: Soft currency. Used to upgrade cards. Infinite supply.
2.  **$MIND Tokens**: Hard currency. Limited supply. **Real Value.**

## How to Earn $MIND
You cannot "buy" $MIND. You must **Mine** it.

### Method 1: The Passive Mine (DePIN) ☀️
*   **Req**: Level 10 + "Solar Miner" Card.
*   **Action**: Leave your phone/PC on "Worker Mode" at night.
*   **Mechanism**: Your device processes small tasks for the Global Network (NIN).
*   **Reward**: You wake up to fresh $MIND in your wallet.

### Method 2: The Active Mine (Vibe Coding) ⌨️
*   **Req**: Level 15 + "Python Basic" Card.
*   **Action**: Accept a "Quest" from the Mission Board.
    *   *Example*: "Generate a React Button Component."
*   **Mechanism**: Use the **Mumega Assistant** to generate the code. Verify it. Submit it.
*   **Reward**: Massive $MIND payout (e.g., $10 USD equivalent per task).

## Cashing Out 💳
*   **For Iranians**: Swap $MIND -> USDT -> Shetab (Rials) via authorized Guild Leaders.
*   **For Global**: Swap $MIND -> SOL/TON on DEX.

**Your Mind is the Gold Mine. Start digging.**
