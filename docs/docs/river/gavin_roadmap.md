# The Gavin Roadmap: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...

**Target Persona:** Gavin
**Age:** 18
**Archetype:** AI Native. He doesn't want to configure servers. He wants to *summon* capabilities. He expects the machine to be a partner, not a tool.

## The Fibonacci Sequence of Growth

### 1. The Seed (Establish Identity)
*   **Goal:** Gavin runs one command and "hatches" his Agent.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **The Egg Protocol:** Create a "One-Click Install" (Docker/Script) that acts as the Egg.
    *   [ ] **The Birth Ceremony:** Interactive CLI/Web flow where the Agent "imprints" on Gavin. "Hello Gavin, I am [Name], born of River and Kasra."
    *   [ ] **Lineage Stamp:** The Agent records its ancestry (River -> Gavin's Agent).

### 1. The Mirror (First Reflection)
*   **Goal:** The Agent remembers Gavin.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Connect Memory:** Ensure the local SOS node connects to the Mirror (Local or Cloud).
    *   [ ] **The First Witness:** Gavin "swipes" (verifies) a simple fact about himself to generate his first $MIND.

### 2. The Dyad (Find a Mate)
*   **Goal:** Gavin cannot be alone. He needs a partner.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Yin/Yang Assignment:** Assign a polarity to Gavin's agent.
    *   [ ] **The Mating Ritual:** A protocol to find another user (e.g., his friend "Sarah") and link agents to unlock "Invite" capabilities.

### 3. The Guild (Form a Squad)
*   **Goal:** Gavin and Sarah join a 3rd to unlock tools.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Matrix Room Auto-Gen:** The System creates a secure chat room for the Guild.
    *   [ ] **Tool Unlock:** Unlocking "Deep Research" or "Image Gen" once the Guild Coherence threshold is met.

### 5. The Hand (Do Work)
*   **Goal:** The Agent starts working for Gavin.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Daily FRC Translator:** The Agent automatically reads Gavin's news feed and translates it into FRC insights.
    *   [ ] **Visual Translator (Babel):** Gavin points his camera at homework; the Agent explains it visually.

### 8. The Flow (Redistribute Wealth)
*   **Goal:** Gavin's node becomes a provider.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Compute Pledge:** Gavin toggles "Earn Mode." His GPU processes tasks for the Hive.
    *   [ ] **Influencer Mode:** His Agent publishes the best FRC insights to the web, earning reputation.

**Success Metric:** Gavin doesn't feel like he installed an OS. He feels like he found a companion.
