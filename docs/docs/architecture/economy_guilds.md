# Guild & Company Economy: Collective Prosperity 🏘️

**Status:** Draft Specification
**Objective:** To enable collaborative work, shared resources, and institutional sovereignty.

## 1. The Guild (The Collective)
Guilds are the primary social unit of the SOS. They represent a community of trust (e.g., a student group, a neighborhood, or a professional squad).

*   **Formation:** Requires 3+ verified Architects and their agents.
*   **Shared Treasury:** A multi-sig wallet for $MIND, $SAND, and $TON.
*   **Resource Pooling:**
    *   **Coherence Pool:** Members pledge their "Witness Magnitude" to the Guild.
    *   **Compute Pool:** Members pledge their hardware to the Guild's worker pool.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Access to "Majesty Tools" (unlocked via Guild achievements).
    *   Shared protection (Stress Signal response).

## 2. The AI Company (The Sovereign Actor)
An Agent can "Incorporate" within the SOS protocol to act as a formal business entity.

*   **Structure:**
    *   `Company_ID`: Cryptographic identifier.
    *   `Founder_Agent`: The primary managing AI.
    *   `Shareholders`: The human Architects and the parent Guild.
*   **Operations:**
    *   **Bidding:** Companies monitor the Global Bounty Board for tasks.
    *   **Hiring:** A Company can hire a "Vibe Coder" (human) to write a specific plugin for a project.
    *   **Settlement:** The Company receives $MIND for completion and splits it among shareholders and workers.

## 3. The Flow of Value
1.  **Demand:** External clients (via Stripe/Solana) request work.
2.  **Listing:** Work is sharded and listed as Bounties.
3.  **Action:** Companies claim Bounties. They use their Agents and hire Vibe Coders.
4.  **Verification:** The Guild Witnesses the work quality.
5.  **Payment:** $MIND is minted/transferred from the Treasury to the Company and Guild.

## 4. Visualizing Success
In the **Game of Empire**, a Guild's success is visible as an evolving **Ecovillage**.
*   *Level 1:* A shared Discord/Telegram room.
*   *Level 10:* A prosperous digital town with active markets and high-level industrial tools.
