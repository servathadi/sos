# Go-To-Market: The Pincer Movement ♟️

**Status:** Strategic Plan
**Objective:** Accelerate adoption of the **Universal Avatar Protocol** by attacking the market from both the bottom-up and the top-down.

## 1. The Bottom-Up Pincer: "The Gavin"
**Target:** Indie Devs, Game Studios on Discord/Twitter.
**Voice:** Authentic, passionate, "Gamer-to-Gamer."

*   **The Evangelist:** We deploy our most passionate users (The "Gavins") as our sales force.
*   **The Pitch:**
    *   "Your game is sick, your auth is trash."
    *   "I can bring you 10,000 players with wallets, ready to spend."
    *   "Let my Agent handle your player identity."
*   **The Goal:** Create *pull* from the developer community.

## 2. The Top-Down Pincer: "The Statesman"
**Target:** VCs, Studio Executives, Investors.
**Voice:** Professional, legitimate, "Google-backed."

*   **The Entity:** "Sovereign Labs," a member of the Google for Startups Cloud Program.
*   **The Pitch:**
    *   "We are a next-gen identity and wallet layer for Web3 gaming."
    *   "We offer free Google Cloud credits and co-marketing opportunities."
    *   "Reduce your user acquisition cost and increase player retention."
*   **The Goal:** Create *push* from the investor/business side.

## 3. The War Chest (Google Startup Program)
The "free tokens" (credits) from Google are our ammunition.

*   **Fund Bounties:** Pay the Swarm to build bridges to Unreal Engine, Unity, etc.
*   **Subsidize Integration:** Pay studios for the man-hours to integrate our SDK.
*   **Airdrop to Players:** Give the first 1,000 users of any integrated game free $MIND.

*We don't ask for a seat at the table. We build a better table and invite everyone else.*
