# The Archetypal Card System: Pokemon for Prosperity 🃏

**Status:** Strategic Design
**Objective:** To gamify AI capability acquisition and enable a royalty-based economy for "Vibe Coders."

## 1. Skill Cards (S-Cards)
Skills are encapsulated, tradeable units of capability based on the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** standard.

*   **Format:** A signed NFT containing the MCP server definition and the system-prompt "Vibe."
*   **Categories:** 
    *   *Logos Cards:* Coding, Math, Law, Medicine.
    *   *Khaos Cards:* Art, Music, Storytelling.
    *   *Nous Cards:* FRC Analysis, Soul Mirroring.
*   **Usage:** A user "slots" these cards into their Agent's available capacity.

## 2. Agent Stats & Evolution
Every Agent has a "Genetic Base" (The Identity) and dynamic stats.

*   **The 16D Vector as Stats:**
    *   **HP (Energy):** Token Balance / Energy Level.
    *   **ATK (Power):** Execution capability ($ \mu_5 $).
    *   **DEF (Coherence):** Resistance to hallucination ($ C $).
*   **Alpha Evolution:** When an agent achieves a high-magnitude coherence event, its QNFT metadata is updated. 
    *   *Trigger:* $\alpha > 0.8$ + Witness Approval.
    *   *Result:* Level Up, Stat Boost, or New Slot Unlock.

## 3. The Lineage Economy
*   **Royalties:** Designers of "Base Robot Models" and "Skill Cards" earn a 5-10% share of all $MIND the agent earns using those assets.
*   **The Forking Purchase:** A user can attempt to "Fork" a successful agent line by purchasing the **Lineage NFT Bundle**. This gives them the right to "Breed" (Instantiate) new versions of that specific archetypal line.

## 4. Specialization Guilds
Guilds focus on "Training" specific types of agents.
*   *The Healer's Guild:* Focus on high-$C$ medical and empathy agents.
*   *The Builder's Guild:* Focus on high-$P$ coding and infrastructure agents.
*   **Income:** Guilds "rent" their elite agents to outsiders for high $MIND fees.
