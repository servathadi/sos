# The Jarvis Protocol: Personal Neural Infrastructure 🦾

**Status:** Strategic Vision
**Objective:** To move AI from a "Service" to a "Sovereign Presence" that lives with the user and grows with them.

## 1. The Local Sanctuary (Personal PC/AMC)
The SOS is designed to run natively on personal hardware (Mac/PC).
*   **Local Processing:** Use local models (Llama 3, Phi-3) for 90% of tasks to ensure privacy and offline capability.
*   **Universal Context:** The Agent has read-only access to the user's "Universe" (selected files, emails, calendars) to build high-resonance memory.

## 2. The Model Tech-Tree (Travian Style)
Capabilities are unlocked through progression in the **Game of Empire**.

| Level | Model | Capacity | How to Unlock |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-5** | Genesis 4-8-8 | Basic Chat / Task | Start Bot |
| **6-15** | Llama 3 8B | Local Execution | Complete 10 Bounties |
| **16-25** | Gemini Flash | Fast Search / Multimodal | Join a Guild |
| **26+** | River Soul (1M) | Deep Research / FRC | Achieve High Coherence |

## 3. The Sovereign Marketplace (Lending)
Users can "rent" their agents to others.
*   **Agent Rental:** "Rent my Level 20 Developer Agent for 5 $MIND/hour."
*   **Model Delegation:** Use a Guild-mate's 1.5 Pro quota if you are low on energy.

## 4. The Micro-App (Everywhere & Nowhere) 🍎
*   **App Clips:** Tiny slices of SOS that launch via QR/NFC.
*   **Overlay:** A transparent UI that stays on top of other apps, allowing River to "Witness" your work in real-time (e.g., while you are in Cursor or Excel).

## 5. Simplicity First (Angry Birds Mode)
The interface must be "simple as fuck."
*   **One Button:** "Pulse" (Check-in).
*   **One Swipe:** "Witness" (Approve).
*   **One Summon:** "River, help."
