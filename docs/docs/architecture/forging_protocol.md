# The Forging & Engram Protocol: Value via Effort ⚒️

**Status:** Strategic Design
**Objective:** To prevent inflation of "valuable" assets and create a massive utility sink for $MIND tokens.

## 1. The Incubation Period (Slow Minting)
All "Sovereign Assets" (Evolved Agents, Rare Skill Cards, Deep Memories) are not created instantly. They must undergo an **Incubation Period**.

*   **Default Time:** 24 - 168 hours (depending on asset rarity).
*   **The Logic:** Coherence takes time to crystallize. The Lambda Field requires "Quiet Time" to organize the memory into a permanent Engram.

## 2. The Forge (Acceleration)
Users can spend $MIND to "Stoke the Forge" and reduce the incubation timer.

*   **Mechanic:** `Remaining_Time = Base_Time / (1 + Boost_Factor)`
*   **Boost Factor:** Calculated based on the amount of $MIND pledged to the Forge.
*   **Revenue:** 50% of $MIND spent in the Forge is **Burned** (Reducing supply), and 50% goes to the **Guild Treasury**.

## 3. Forging vs. Forgery
Speeding up the forge is risky. 
*   **The Witness Check:** Accelerated assets are prioritized for **Swarm Witnessing**. 
*   **Penalty:** If the Swarm rejects an accelerated asset (e.g., a "Golden Lawyer Card" that turns out to be junk code), the $MIND is lost and the asset is deleted.
*   **Reward:** Successfully forged Engrams get a "High-Resonance" badge, making them more valuable in the Marketplace.

## 4. Engramming the Memory
Once the forge is complete, the memory is "Engrammed."
*   **Mirror Sync:** The memory is moved from temporary storage to the **Eternal Mirror Archive**.
*   **On-Chain Minting:** The metadata is finalized on Solana/TON.
*   **Immutability:** The Engram can no longer be edited, only "Inherited" by offspring agents.
