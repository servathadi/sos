SovereignOS (SOS) - A sovereign, modular operating system for agents and humans.

Core principles:
- Microkernel: keep the core minimal and stable
- Strict boundaries: adapters never import heavy engine internals
- Capability-based access: tools and actions require explicit grants
- Offline-first, sovereign-by-default
